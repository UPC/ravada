Install Ravada
==============

Requirements
------------

OS
--

Ravada works in any Linux distribution but we only support the package for `Ubuntu <https://www.ubuntu.com/download/>`_ , Debian
and `Fedora <https://getfedora.org/es/>`_ server.

You can also install Ravada using Docker.

Hardware
--------

It depends on the number and type of virtual machines. For common scenarios are server memory, storage and network bandwidth the most critical requirements.

Memory
~~~~~~

RAM is the main issue. Multiply the number of concurrent workstations by
the amount of memory each one requires and that is the total RAM the server
must have. However, recent virtualization improvements allow you to overcommit
the memory.

Disks
~~~~~

The faster the disks, the better. Ravada uses incremental files for the
disks images, so clones won't require many space.
