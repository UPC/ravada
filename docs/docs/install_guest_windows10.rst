Install Windows 10
==================

These are guidelines to install Windows 10 inside a  Ravada KVM Guest.


Base Guest
----------

The guest should have more than 3 GB of RAM. If you are planning to run
many services you should create the virtual machine with more memory.
You can increase it later if you want to keep it slim.

At least 30GB disk drive is required. A swap partition should also be
added when creating the virtual machine.

When the machine is created start it from *Admin Tools menu*, click on
*Virtual Machines* to see a list. At the right there is a bunch of buttons.
Click on *view* to start and access the virtual machine console.

Setup

When the installations it's finished, you need to install:

* qemu-guest agent, see the instructions here: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Qemu-guest-agent#Windows
* make sure that acpi service it's activated.

                                                     



Use a swap partition for pagefiles
----------------------------------

By default the Windows pagefiles will go to the C: disk drive. That will make the clones partitions
grow up too much and fill your host disk drive.
It should go to the *SWAP* volume, problaby in your D: or E: drive.

In this link you can see how to move pagefiles to another disk:
