Development Tools
-----------------

We're proud to program it in `Perl`_ based on `TDD`_. Perl 5 is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 30 years of development. `More about why we love Perl...`_.

We use `Mojolicious`_, a real-time web framework. We use `MySQL`_. It's the world's most popular open source database. With its proven performance, reliability, and ease-of-use.

We use a lot of powerful free source like `GNU`_/Linux `Ubuntu`_, `KVM`_ or `Spice`_, among others. Responsive web made with `Bootstrap`_ and `AngularJS`_.

We use `Weblate`_ to provide a cleaner and easy to use interface for translators. It's meant for adapting applications and text to enable their usability in a particular cultural or linguistic market.

Then we build documentation and host it in `Read the Docs`_ for you.
