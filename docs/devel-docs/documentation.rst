Ravada Documentation
====================

We have 2 kinds of documents for Ravada : MarkDown and reStructuredText.

MarkDown
---------

MarkDown (md) files are the default for github documents. It is used for
files stored in the code branches of Ravada.

This is a `guide <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>`__ for
the github markdown flavour.

You can view it before commit with the MarkDown Preview
`Google Chrome extension <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions>`__

reStructuredText
----------------

reStructuredText (rst) files are used for the advanced documentation of
Ravada that you can find in our
`readthedocs web site <http://ravada.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

You can read more about *rst* files at the
`docutils rst <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__

The Google Chrome MarkDown Preview extension is supposed to render *rst* files too
but it lacks some features like remote links. It is better to render those files with
`RestView <https://pypi.org/project/restview/>`__.
